# Particle Swarm Optimization Implementations

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files that implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm using different approaches.

## PSO_Pyswarms.ipynb

The file `PSO_Pyswarms.ipynb` demonstrates the implementation of the PSO algorithm using the PySwarms library. PySwarms is a powerful Python library that provides efficient and easy-to-use implementations of various PSO variants. In this notebook, we utilize PySwarms to solve an optimization problem, visualize the optimization process using PySwarms visualizer, and analyze the results. The notebook also makes use of common libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to facilitate data manipulation and visualization. Other functions can be passed into the `Mesher` and `optimizer` calls, and the [Pyswarms Documentation](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyswarms.utils.functions.html) provides a long list of supported functions. 

## PSO_Scratch.ipynb

The file `PSO_Scratch.ipynb` showcases an implementation of the PSO algorithm from scratch. The implementation is inspired by Tam (2021) and is based on the fundamental PSO principles discussed in the website [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-particle-swarm-optimization/#:~:text=Example%20Optimization%20Problem). This notebook demonstrates a step-by-step manual implementation of the PSO algorithm, providing insights into the core mechanics and underlying mathematics of PSO.

Both notebooks offer valuable perspectives on PSO implementations and provide opportunities for comparison and learning. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code in these notebooks to gain a better understanding of Particle Swarm Optimization.
